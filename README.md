Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Model
Project Description
This project involves building a model to recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. The objective is to empower users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices, promoting healthier lifestyles.

Features
Food Recognition: Identifies food items from images.
Calorie Estimation: Provides approximate calorie content for recognized items.
Workflow:
Image preprocessing
Feature extraction
Model training for classification and calorie prediction
Steps to Run the Project
Dataset Setup:

Collect or use an existing dataset of labeled food images with calorie information.
Organize the data into training and testing sets.
Install Dependencies:
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

numpy
pandas
opencv-python
tensorflow/keras
matplotlib
Run the command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python tensorflow matplotlib  
Preprocessing:

Resize images to a standard size (e.g., 128x128 pixels).
Normalize pixel values for consistent input.
Extract features for classification and calorie prediction.
Train the Model:

Use the preprocessed dataset to train a classification model for food recognition.
Use regression techniques to estimate calorie content.
Run the Script:

Execute the Python script to classify food items and display calorie estimates.
Files Included
food_recognition.py: Main script for food recognition and calorie estimation.
README.TXT: Documentation for the project.
Future Enhancements
Expand to include a wider range of food items and cuisines.
Enable real-time calorie estimation through mobile or web applications.
Credits
Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
Dataset: Custom or publicly available food datasets with calorie annotations
This project provides an innovative approach to dietary tracking and nutrition management!
